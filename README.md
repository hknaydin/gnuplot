# gnuplot

This repository includes reading data from the file with gnuplot. Go to the path where the data is on the terminal. 
Run terminal and switch to write mode with gnuplot command. Then the code block in the pdr file is directly pasted into the gnuplot interface. 
All of them should be pasted in one way, not separately.
